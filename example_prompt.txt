Please help me write a Python program to render an ASCII character set of the Mandelbrot set.

The program should:
1. Define the complex plane boundaries
2. Iterate over each pixel position
3. Calculate whether the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set
4. Map the iteration count to ASCII characters
5. Print the result as ASCII art

Include comments explaining the mathematics behind the Mandelbrot set.
